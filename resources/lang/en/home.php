You can transfer a cryptocurrency to someone on the internet without an intermediary.<br><br>In 2009, the first fully decentralized cryptocurrency appeared, Bitcoin, which was created by Satoshi Nakamoto along with the software that supports it (Blockchain).<br><br>Blockchain is a single registry, agreed and distributed in several nodes of a network.

This value is subject to an offer and a demand so it can vary in a matter of hours.<br><br>This happens exactly with cryptocurrencies, due to their decentralized control the price of it can go up or down daily.<br><br>Let's see an example: Let's say that you enter to play with the value of a stock whose price is 50 dollars (to say any value), you buy it but hours later its value increased by 100 dollars, at this point you sell it and generate a 100% profitability on the initial value, this profitability is your profit with that operation.",
